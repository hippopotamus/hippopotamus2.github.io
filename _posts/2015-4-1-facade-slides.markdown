I gave this lecture a little bit ago. A recruiter from IBM was in. I was excited to hear his thoughts on it, but, because of time, my talk got axed and I ended up giving it to just the students later on in the day.

Hopefully it's easy to follow. I wrote it for beginners to understand. My hope with lectures like this is to pass on the idea that making projects is more about design than syntax.
