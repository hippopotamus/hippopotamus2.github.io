## Hello

Welcome.  
I decided to redo my blog, since I never post on my old one, I used someone else's stylez the last time, and I told my students they need to have a blog and use it. I'm going to grab the posts (post?) that were actually useful from the last one and put them here.  
At the time of this writing, I'm teaching and developing curriculum at Byte Academy, a bootcamp geared toward financial technologies. I like it. I learn a lot and am around computers for the vast majority of my waking hours.  
We've also been given freedom in the curriculum development. I've had a lot of ideas on how people learn, and I get to see them in action now--it's been great (can you do em dashes in markdown?). So far the students have been happy, and it's been really rewarding watching them learn. It's crazy how fast people can learn and grow, if they want to.  
If you're a BA student, stop reading this and get to work.
